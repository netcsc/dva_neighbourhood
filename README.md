## Developer's guide

### API

The API returns the housing data from postgres db. The database has been seeded with the data as specified in NY_neighborhood_avg_sales_2018.csv.

The API app is built in python and has dependencies as specified in the requirements.txt.
If you want to run this API locally:

1. Install virtualenv https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/
2. Create virtual env `virtualenv .venv`
3. Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Please note you need to have postgresql installed as well.

Server IP: `54.89.25.157`
Endpoints: `/boroughs` to get the aggregate housing data i.e `http://54.89.25.157/boroughs`
Endpoints: `/crimes` to get the aggregate crime data i.e `http://54.89.25.157/crimes`

To run app locally `

#### Test API locally

1. Start local postgrest database `docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=cse6242 -p 5432:5432 -d postgres`
1. Create a database in postgres CREATE DATABASE neighbourhood;
1. Start the API server `gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:api --reload`

#### Logging into API server

It's hosted on Amazon EC2 instance.
