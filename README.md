## Developer's guide
### Frontend

Frontend is written using D3.js which includes following files:
1. index.html -- the main html file
2. map.js -- the d3.js file for map visualization and user interaction
3. nyc.json -- the NYC topojson file that contains NYC neighborhood information.
4. project.css -- the css for the project.

In the map.js file, it will make call our api server to get the housing price data and the crime data.

```
  .defer(d3.json, "http://54.89.25.157/boroughs")
  .defer(d3.json, "http://54.89.25.157/crimes")
```

It can also change to use local file in case of no internet
```
  .defer(d3.csv,"NY_neighborhood_avg_sales_all.csv")
  .defer(d3.csv,"crime_index_per_neighborhood_data/crime_all.csv")
```

#### Package and run the code
##### use hosted website
We have hosted our application in the cloud, you can access it at http://40.84.17.159/

#### Run the application locally
we use [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to package and run our application

1. Install docker and docker-compose
2. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the web server
3. go to http://localhost/ to access the web application

Note that the web app will use the hosted api server that we have hosted in the cloud see API session if you want to setup the api server locally.
### API

The API returns the housing data from postgres db. The database has been seeded with the data as specified in NY_neighborhood_avg_sales_2018.csv.
for housing data and crime_all.csv for crime data.

The API app is built in python and has dependencies as specified in the requirements.txt.
If you want to run this API locally:

1. Install virtualenv https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/
2. Create virtual env `virtualenv .venv`
3. Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Please note you need to have postgresql installed as well (see postgres session for details).
5. Start the API using `gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:api --reload`. API server is started on http://localhost:5000  

##### Hosted API
Server IP: `54.89.25.157`
Endpoints: `/boroughs` to get the aggregate housing data i.e `http://54.89.25.157/boroughs`
Endpoints: `/crimes` to get the aggregate crime data i.e `http://54.89.25.157/crimes`

### Data store
We use postgres database as our datastore. Easiest way to run posrgres database locally is using docker container

1. Start local postgrest database `docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=cse6242 -p 5432:5432 -d postgres`
2. login to postgres database use user postgres and password cse6242
3. Create a database in postgres CREATE DATABASE neighbourhood;

### Machine learning model

#### Customized recommendation model

Run jupyter notebook recommendation.ipynb

#### Price prediction

Run ```python price_prediction.py``` to generate prediction


#### Logging into API server

It's hosted on Amazon EC2 instance.
`ssh -i cse6242-project.pem ubuntu@ec2-54-89-25-157.compute-1.amazonaws.com`
The ssh-key is inside the repo. The project is in the home directory.
